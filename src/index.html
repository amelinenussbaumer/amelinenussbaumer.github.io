      <!--<h1 class="title">About me</h1><hr />-->

      
      <p>Working closely with content experts, I manage and deliver training projects from start to finish, including planning, design, development, facilitation and evaluation of trainings. My projects include eLearning and blended courses, interactive software training, trainings of trainers, animated videos, mobile apps, and graphic design. Working in international organisations and as a consultant, I provided training solutions to thousands of colleagues and local authorities worldwide. </p>

      <p>One of the things I love most about working in adult training is translating complex topics into simple
      and engaging content. I enjoy the teamwork with experts and learning about new topics, while developing both my creativity and technical skills. Ultimately, I love helping people with relevant and action-oriented learning resources and accompanying learners along their journey.</p>
      
      <!--<p>In 2020 I worked for a conservation NGO in Kenya, <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/" target="_blank">A Rocha</a>. I created engaging graphical designs to promote their community conservation work and raised funds for projects directly protecting threatened habitats and endangered species. Outside of work, you'll find me swimming in the nearest body of water, lost in nature with my husband and daughter, or cooking/talking about food with friends.</p>-->

            I <b>start from learners' needs</b> and ensure they are involved throughout the training development
            process, providing input and feedback at each stage in order to make the final product as relevant for them
            as possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb" style="color:#729460"></i></span>
            Learners perform better when they can to <b>actively engage with content</b>. I therefore strive to give learners opportunities to practice specific skills and scenario-based decision-making in a safe environment.

          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fab fa-hubspot" style="color:#729460"></i></span>
            <b>Peer-to-peer learning</b> is an essential characteristic of adult learning. To enrich the learning
            experience, I seek to empower learners to share practices and learn from each other's experiences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-chalkboard-teacher" style="color:#729460"></i></span>
            I use communities of practice, group projects, virtual classrooms, drop-in workshops and facilitated forums to maintain a <b>human connection</b> in online learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-eye" style="color:#729460"></i></span>
            In a rapidly changing working environment, <b>agility and rapid prototyping</b> are key. I understand experts' need to visualize learning materials early on, and therefore provide MVPs early, and quickly integrate feedback every step of the way.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="fa-li"><i class="fas fa-user-friends" style="color:#729460"></i></span>
            I work well in teams, and having worked in international organisations and various countries, I thrive in <b>multi-cultural contexts</b>. I am <b>bilingual in French and English</b>, have working knowledge of German and know basic Spanish.

           </div>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>The objective of this institutional training was to build a Speak Up Culture within the organization. The challenge was to engage a very large and diverse audience (15 000 staff members) to learn from a compliance training rather than just "tick the boxes". We used the High Performance Learning Journey methodology (commit, crawl, walk, run stages) to achieve critical work behaviors.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Practice with scenario-based e-learning</h4>
        <p>Learners can practice critical behaviors in a safe environment with realistic branching scenarios. They can try out different options and see the consequences of various courses of action. Each scenario ends with an infographic summarizing the key takeaways.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Integrity_1.jpg">

        <h4 class="title is-5">Apply learning with a self-reflection journal and on-the-job discussions</h4>
        <p>Going a step further, learners are invited to log their personal reflection in a learner journal and to have conversations with colleagues, complementing individual online learning with social learning.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Integrity_2.jpg">

        <h4 class="title is-5">End training with a collective event to build commitment</h4>
        <p>Learners are faced with increasingly complex situations as they progress through the training. They end the training with a collective event to build engagement and facilitate the transfer of key learnings to real life.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>The objective of this training was to train field humanitarian workers into a new methodology of interacting with beneficiaries. The challenge was to deliver an efficient behavior-based training online. </p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Scenario-based learning</h4>
        <p>Working closely with content experts and field workers, we drafted realistic scenarios for each stage of a project. This format allowed learners to practice how they interact with community members, and test out different options, in a safe environment. At several points in the scenario, we take a step out of the storyline and draw out key lessons learned. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/scenario_1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Short eLearning module</h4>
        <p>To accompany the scenarios, a short eLearning module was produced to provide contexte and rationale for this new methodology, as well as outline its key components. It includes formative assessment questions throughout to keep learners active and engaged.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/scenario_2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">On-the-job checklists</h4>
        <p>To help learners transfer their learning to their work, We created summary checklists of all the points to consider at each stage of the project, which can be printed and used on the job. </p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>With covid-related restrictions, many face-to-face trainings had to be adapted to be held fully online witin a short space of time. Drawing on various online learning modalities, this week-long classroom training was redesigned into a 3 week online learning path, including both self-paced modules and facilitated virtual classrooms.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">eLearning modules for theoretical content</h4>
        <p>We took the opportunity to review all the content, simplified and and divided it in small chunks to create short eLearning courses. To diversify the format and stay within the project short schedule, some content was also conveyed through recorded PowerPoint presentations. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/nutrition_1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Linking self-paced phase with virtual classrooms</h4>
        <p>Throughout the self-paced phase, learners had various exercises to complete and questions to think about, which would form the backbone of the discussion in webinars - linking personal learning with social exchanges.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Resilience-img-2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Virtual classrooms for practical exercices and case study</h4>
        <p>Having moved most of the theoretical content to online modules, we kept application exercises for virtual classroom settings, and used a combination of social collaboration tools (Teams, Mural) to facilitate group work online.</p>

  <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
  <p>Following the launch of new standards for Protection field work, a wide range of humanitarian workers on the field had to be trained on these updated standards. The challenge was to reach a broad audience: learners are spread out across the world, work in different organisations, speak different languages and spend a lot of time in the field.</p>
  <h4 class="title is-5">Multilingual eLearning course</h4>
  <p>I managed external providers commissioned to design an eLearning course translated in 5 languages. I then
    hosted this course both on the ICRC Learning Platform and partnered with <a
      href="https://ready.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/a3225f1c-5be5-48fb-8a56-9dbbbb59fe45"
      target="_blank">DisasterRelief</a>, to ensure broad access across organisations.</p>

  <img src="/assets/img/Project1_Img1.jpg">

  <h4 class="title is-5">Engaging learners with animations</h4>
  <p>To make the new standards as accessible and engaging as possible, we included animations, practical examples, and
    formative assessment questions.</p>
  <img src="/assets/img/Project1_Img2.jpg">

  <h4 class="title is-5">A mobile app to reach field workers</h4>
  <p>Working with another external provider, we developed a mobile app including both the standards and the eLearning
    modules in order to facilitate seamless access to the standards for field workers when they are out of their office. </p>

              </div>
              <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
              <p>The objective of this project was to update both the content and format of an existing software training
                intended for staff spread out in remote locations and changing regularly due to high staff turnover. User
                feedback indicated that this software was perceived as ineffective and not engaging. </p>
              <h4 class="title is-5">Animated videos to build engagement</h4>
              <p>Working in a team with content experts, we opened the course with a series of animated videos starting from the learner's perspective, to convey rationale for this software and increase engagement. Using storytelling, humor, and shared organizational references, we created light and appealing content to overcome learners' initial resistance to this topic. </p>
              <img src="/assets/img/Project4-Img1.jpg">
              <h4 class="title is-5">Simplified user interface to explain key concepts</h4>
              <p>Animated videos lend themselves well to simplifying complex subjects, in this case, complex software
                interfaces. This helps learners to focus on the essential information we want to convey. I designed simplified
                interfaces in Adobe Illustrator and integrated them in the animated video production software (Vyond). </p>
              <img src="/assets/img/Project4-Img2.jpg">
              <h4 class="title is-5">Interactive videos to practice in a safe environment</h4>
              <p>To keep learners actively engaged, we created a case study used throughout the modules of the course. Learners enter data from a realistic project in the application, thus practising going through all the steps in a safe environment. This simulation was developed through remote collaboration with the software expert based in Belgrade, using Adobe Captivate.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>To accompany the launch of a new Communities digital platform, aspiring community managers needed training on
          how to set up, launch, facilitate, and manage their communities. The training had to include both technical
          and communication skills, and had to be available for new community managers at any time. </p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Combining external learning content and tailor-made resources</h4>
        <p>Working with the platform manager, we partnered with <a href="https://communityroundtable.com/"
            target="_blank">The Community Roundtable</a> , who provided core content through a series of short videos
          and quizzes. I built a blended learning path that integrated this external content with tailor-made ICRC
          resources, case studies, and technical face-to-face workshops. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project2-Img1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Work-based learning: applied exercises</h4>
        <p>To make this training directly applicable to work, all exercises provided templates for community managers to
          plan and launch their community. These are a direct follow-up exercise from the video, but also constitute
          building blocks towards launching a community at the ICRC, directly connecting the training to learners' day-to-day projects.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project2-Img2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">A face-to-face workshop to receive tailored feedback</h4>
        <p>Integrated in an asynchronous training, a monthly drop-in session offers an opportunity for learners to ask
          questions, share ideas and get individualized support on their community. </p>

        </div>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>With the increasing complexity of organizational structures and systems, there is a growing need for
          translating complex subjects into simple messages for a wide audience with varying levels of understanding. Videos can build engagement and save time by avoiding repetition of information. </p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Scenario-based videos</h4>
        <p>Working with content experts, I scripted and produced whiteboard/animated videos summarizing the topic at
          hand a few minutes, using an animation software called Vyond. Stories always start from the learner's perspective and questions, and use familiar work situations to build the scenario.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project7-Img3.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">The power of analogies</h4>
        <p>I used analogies to relate complex subjects to common situations. For example, we compared business intelligence to the food industry, and results-based management to a doctor's appointment. These videos successfully conveyed abstract information to a wide audience. To improve engagement, robotic voices were replaced with human voices, recorded and edited using <a ref="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>.
        <img src="/assets/img/Project7-Img1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Whiteboard animations</h4>
        <p>Whiteboard animations lend themselves well to explaining complex topics in an accessible way, by gradually adding layers of information. In this case, I used a whiteboard animation to outline reporting requirements to field officers - overlaying both
          departmental and organizational frameworks, with a voice guiding the viewer throughout the timeline. To ensure the content is relevant for the viewer, we use a realistic operational project throughout the explanation.</a>. </p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>Online communities of practice are an increasingly popular way to connect humanitarian practitioners working in remote locations and promote sharing of experience and good practices. With the launch of a new communities platform came the challenge of designing efficient interfaces and building user engagement.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Designing a simple user interface</h4>
        <p>When introducing a new digital tool, simplifying the user experience and clearly outlining what users have to
          gain from it is critical. I worked with community managers to design a simple graphic chart for their community
          space. I chose to use hand-drawn illustrations to help users view it as an informal space, where they feel safe exchanging questions and experiences. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Comm_Img1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Providing tutorials and guidelines</h4>
        <p>I assisted Community managers by creating simple and visual guidelines for new users, outlining both the
          purpose and steps to navigate the community space.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Comm_Img2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Using communities as part of the learning ecosystem</h4>
        <p>Communities of practice are a great tool to promote and complement learning paths, whether it is
          reaching out to the training audience to promote content, using the platform as a learning forum, gathering feedback on specific questions, or better understanding learners' issues and work realities. </p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4>
        <p>Working with <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/" target="_blank">A Rocha</a>, a community conservation
          organization in Kenya, I supported project teams with communications and fundraising. Both of these go hand in hand and are  critical to raise the support needed for the organization.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Proposal writing and crowdfunding campaigns</h4>
        <p>I led two crowdfunding campaigns, using infographics to convey key numbers and messages on<a href="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://www.changa.co.ke/" target="_blank">m-Changa</a>, a Kenyan crowdfunding platform. These campaigns require powerful and simple messages and engaging visual imagery to raise attention. I also successfully drafted and submitted a pre-proposal to the IUCN, which led us to be selected for the second round.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-5">Graphic design of communication materials</h4>
        <p>Using a graphical chart in line with the NGO's work, I designed various communication and design materials
          such as <a
            href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2020/08/ARK_Annual_Review_Web_compressed-1.pdf"
            target="_blank">Annual Reports</a>, posters, and branded objects.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project9-Img2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Regular communications</h4>
        <p>To ensure regular communication, I used tools such as <a ref="https://hootsuite.com/"
            target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> and <a ref="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> to
          organize social media posts and monthly newsletters, and drafted blog articles on current projects and stories.</p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4>
         <p>Given the increasing complexity of organizational structures and systems, there is a growing need for
          translating complex subjects to a wide audience with varying levels of understanding, and find a media to
          replace repetitive and time-consuming face-to-face briefings. </p>
        <h4 class="title is-5">Creating a story</h4>
        <p> Together with content experts, I scripted and produced whiteboard animation videos summarizing the topic at
          hand in 5 mins maximum, using an animation software called Vyond. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project5-Img1.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">Adding gradual layers of complexity </h4>
        <p>Whiteboard animations lend themselves well to progressively explain complex topics in an accessible way. In
          this case, I used a whiteboard animation to outline reporting requirements to field officers - overlaying both
          departmental and organizational requirements, with a voice guiding the viewer throughout the timeline. To
          ensure we account for the viewer's reality, we started with an operational project. </p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project5-Img2.jpg">
        <h4 class="title is-5">A versatile learning resource</h4>
        <p>These videos are an increasingly trendy format to communicate key messages to a large audience. Their
          versitality means they can be repurposed in a range of contexts: eLearning paths, workshops, Intranet,
          meetings, etc. To maximize impact, I ensured the video is self-contained and easy to access and share. </p>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Context</h4>
        <p>A wide range of protection workers on the field had to be trained on the updated protection standards.
          Learners are typically spread out across the world, work in different organisations, speak various languages,
          and spend a lot of time in the field.</p>
        <h4 class="title is-4">Multilingual eLearning course</h4>
        <p>I managed external providers commissioned to design an eLearning course translated in 5 languages. I then
          hosted this course both on the ICRC Learning Platform and on <a
            href="https://ready.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/a3225f1c-5be5-48fb-8a56-9dbbbb59fe45"
            target="_blank">DisasterRelief</a>, ensuring broad access across organisations.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/Project1_Img1.jpg">

        <h4 class="title is-4">Engaging learners with animations</h4>
        <p>To make the Standards both more accessible and engaging, we included animations, practical examples, and
          formative questions.</p>
        <img src="/assets/img/Project1_Img2.jpg">

        <h4 class="title is-4">An associated mobile app to reach field workers</h4>
        <p>Working with another provider, we developed a mobile app including both the standards and the e-learning
          modules to facilitate seamless access to the standards for field workers. </p>
