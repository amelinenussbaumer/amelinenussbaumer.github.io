The challenge was to engage a large and diverse audience in completing a compulsory compliance training, and to incite learners towards real behaviour change rather than simply ticking the boxes. We designed the course following High Performance Learning Journey principles.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Practice with scenario-based e-learning</h4><p>With a series of realistic branching scenarios, learners can practice critical behaviors in a safe environment. They can try out different options and see the consequences of various courses of action. Each scenario ends with an infographic summarizing the key takeaways. Following the High Performance Learning Journey methodology, learners are faced with increasingly complex situations as they progress through the training.</p><img src="e593efe34ffe031a6f0a.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Apply learning with a self-reflection journal and on-the-job discussions</h4><p>Going a step further, learners are invited to log their reflections in a personal journal and to have conversations with colleagues, complementing individual online learning with social exchanges.</p><img src="1a5e3299995d8cec558d.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Build commitment through a collective event</h4><p>Learners end the training with a collective event to build engagement and support organizational culture change. Bridging the gap between online learning and on-the-job situations, this event helps facilitate the transfer of key learnings to real life.</p><img src="4577c17da3e81a1efa70.jpg"><div class="caption"></div></section></div><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div><div id="project-2-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Scenario-based learning</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">branching-scenarios</span> <span class="tag">e-learning</span> <span class="tag">instructional-design</span> <span class="tag">project-management</span> <span class="tag">Captivate</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>The objective of this training was to train field humanitarian workers into a new methodology of interacting with beneficiaries. The challenge was to train learners into a specific set of behaviors through a fully online training.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Scenario-based learning</h4><p>Working closely with content experts and field workers, we drafted realistic scenarios for each stage of a project. This format allowed learners to practice how they interact with community members, and test out different options, in a safe environment. At several points in the scenario, we take a step out of the storyline and draw out key lessons learned.</p><img src="064fd9da420418a7f2ea.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Short eLearning module</h4><p>To accompany the scenarios, a short eLearning module was produced to provide contexte and rationale for this new methodology, as well as outline its key components. It includes formative assessment questions throughout to keep learners active and engaged.</p><img src="117631622e8132c197e7.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">On-the-job checklists</h4><p>To help learners transfer their learning to their work, We created summary checklists of all the points to consider at each stage of the project, which can be printed and used on the job.</p><img src="8b89a4faf55479c09662.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-3-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Moving face-to-face trainings online</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">instructional-design</span> <span class="tag">blended-learning</span> <span class="tag">virtual-classroom</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>With covid-related restrictions, many face-to-face trainings had to be adapted to be held fully online witin a short space of time. Drawing on various online learning modalities, this week-long classroom training was redesigned into a 3-week online learning path, including both self-paced modules and facilitated virtual classrooms.</p><h4 class="title is-5">eLearning modules for theoretical content</h4><p>We took the opportunity to review all the content, simplified and and divided it in small chunks to create short eLearning courses. To diversify the format and stay within the project short schedule, some content was also conveyed through recorded PowerPoint presentations.</p><img src="f15d203b35ae864c9f3d.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Linking self-paced phase with virtual classrooms</h4><p>Throughout the self-paced phase, learners had formative quizzes and exercises to complete, as well as questions to think about which then form the backbone of the discussion in webinars - linking personal learning with social exchanges.</p><img src="2c6702ad333febec7dc8.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Virtual classrooms for practical exercices and case study</h4><p>Having moved the theoretical content to online modules, virtual classrooms were focused on application exercises and group work. We relied on a combination of social collaboration tools (Teams and Mural) to facilitate group work online.</p><img src="8199945434917093018a.jpg"> <img src="47986219b2c227028025.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-4-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">eLearning course & mobile app</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">project-management</span> <span class="tag">Mohive</span> <span class="tag">mobile-app</span> <span class="tag">external-provider</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>Following the launch of new standards for Protection field work, a wide range of humanitarian workers on the field had to be updated and trained. The challenge was to reach a broad audience: learners are spread out across the world, work in different organisations, speak different languages and spend a lot of time in the field.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Multilingual eLearning course</h4><p>I managed the external provider commissioned to design and produce an eLearning course, which was then internally translated in 5 languages. I then hosted this course both on the ICRC Learning Platform and partnered with <a href="https://ready.csod.com/ui/lms-learning-details/app/curriculum/a3225f1c-5be5-48fb-8a56-9dbbbb59fe45" target="_blank">DisasterRelief</a>, to ensure broad access across organisations.</p><img src="edb09103373d25728ad2.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Engaging learners with animations</h4><p>To make the new standards as accessible and engaging as possible, we included animations, practical examples, and formative assessment questions.</p><img src="91c667d67bc992751cea.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">A mobile app to reach field workers</h4><p>Working with another external provider, we developed a mobile app including both the standards and the eLearning modules in order to facilitate seamless access to the standards for field workers when they are out of their office.</p><img src="79f16b0a7b53f74349ec.jpg"><div class="caption"></div></section></div><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div><div id="project-5-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Interactive software training</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">software-training</span> <span class="tag">screen-capture</span> <span class="tag">Captivate</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>The objective of this project was to update both the content and format of an existing software training intended for staff spread out in remote locations and changing regularly due to high staff turnover. User feedback indicated that this software was perceived as ineffective and not engaging.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Animated videos to build engagement</h4><p>Working in a team with content experts, we opened the course with a series of animated videos starting from the learner's perspective, to convey rationale for this software and increase engagement. Using storytelling, humor, and shared organizational references, we created light and appealing content to overcome learners' initial resistance to this topic.</p><img src="2effb2f95b43a6d4d320.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Simplified user interface to explain key concepts</h4><p>Animated videos lend themselves well to simplifying complex subjects, in this case, complex software interfaces. This helps learners to focus on the essential information we want to convey. I designed simplified interfaces in Adobe Illustrator and integrated them in the animated video production software (Vyond).</p><img src="7b1c1e8f30f98227447c.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Interactive videos to practice in a safe environment</h4><p>To keep learners actively engaged, we created a case study used throughout the modules of the course. Learners enter data from a realistic project in the application, thus practising going through all the steps in a safe environment. This simulation was developed through remote collaboration with the software expert based in Belgrade, using Adobe Captivate.</p><img src="1c453828041314a8997f.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-6-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Blended learning</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">instructional-design</span> <span class="tag">learning-path</span> <span class="tag">blended-learning</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>To accompany the launch of a new Communities digital platform, aspiring community managers needed training on how to set up, launch, facilitate, and manage their communities. The training had to include both technical and communication skills, and had to be available for new community managers at any time.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Combining external learning content and tailor-made resources</h4><p>Working with the platform manager, we partnered with <a href="https://communityroundtable.com/" target="_blank">The Community Roundtable</a> , who provided core content through a series of short videos and quizzes. I built a blended learning path that integrated this external content with tailor-made ICRC resources, case studies, and technical face-to-face workshops.</p><img src="8277034205c40291371b.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Work-based learning: applied exercises</h4><p>To make this training directly applicable to work, all exercises provided templates for community managers to plan and launch their community. These are a direct follow-up exercise from the video, but also constitute building blocks towards launching a community at the ICRC, directly connecting the training to learners' day-to-day projects.</p><img src="7626b15a485863cee9d3.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">A face-to-face workshop to receive tailored feedback</h4><p>Integrated in an asynchronous training, a monthly drop-in session offers an opportunity for learners to ask questions, share ideas and get individualized support on their community.</p></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-7-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Animated instructional videos</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">animation</span> <span class="tag">scenario-based-learning</span> <span class="tag">whiteboard-animations</span> <span class="tag">micro-learning</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>With the increasing complexity of organizational structures and systems, there is a growing need for translating complex subjects into simple messages for a wide audience with varying levels of understanding. Videos can build engagement and save time by avoiding repetition of information.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Scenario-based videos</h4><p>Working with content experts, I scripted and produced whiteboard/animated videos summarizing the topic at hand a few minutes, using an animation software called Vyond. Stories always start from the learner's perspective and questions, and use familiar work situations to build the scenario.</p><img src="694e2d0253100f603cf3.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">The power of analogies</h4><p>I used analogies to relate complex subjects to common situations. For example, we compared business intelligence to the food industry, and results-based management to a doctor's appointment. These videos successfully conveyed abstract information to a wide audience. To improve engagement, robotic voices were replaced with human voices, recorded and edited using <a ref="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank">Audacity</a>. <img src="253a3fbe34e7a526acc6.jpg"></p><h4 class="title is-5">Whiteboard animations</h4><p>Whiteboard animations lend themselves well to explaining complex topics in an accessible way, by gradually adding layers of information.

With the launch of a new communities platform came the challenge of designing efficient interfaces and building user engagement.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Designing a simple user interface</h4><p>When introducing a new digital tool, simplifying the user experience and clearly outlining what users have to gain from it is critical. I worked with community managers to design a simple graphic chart for their community space. I chose to use hand-drawn illustrations to help users view it as an informal space, where they feel safe exchanging questions and experiences.</p><img src="b8de7e02db15a2edcb60.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Providing tutorials and guidelines</h4><p>I assisted Community managers by creating simple and visual guidelines for new users, outlining both the purpose and steps to navigate the community space.</p><img src="befde1e5aea265863f30.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Using communities as part of the learning ecosystem</h4><p>Communities of practice are a great tool to promote and complement learning paths, whether it is reaching out to the training audience to promote content, using the platform as a learning forum, gathering feedback on specific questions, or better understanding learners' issues and work realities.</p><img src="b79c1a234a62c52f1596.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div><div id="project-9-modal" class="modal"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">NGO communications and fundraising</p><button class="delete" aria-label="close"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">proposal-writing</span> <span class="tag">crowdfunding</span> <span class="tag">graphic-design</span> <span class="tag">social-media</span></div><h4 class="title is-5">Context</h4><p>Working with <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/" target="_blank">A Rocha</a>, a community conservation organization in Kenya, I supported project teams with communications and fundraising. Both of these go hand in hand and are critical to raise the support needed for the organization.</p><h4 class="title is-5">Proposal writing and crowdfunding campaigns</h4><p>I led two crowdfunding campaigns, using infographics to convey key numbers and messages on <a href="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> and <a href="https://www.changa.co.ke/" target="_blank">m-Changa</a>, a Kenyan crowdfunding platform. These campaigns require high-impact and simple messages, and engaging visual imagery to raise attention. I also successfully drafted and submitted a pre-proposal to the IUCN, which led us to be selected for the grant.</p><img src="74dba191f2159a10d413.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Graphic design of communication materials</h4><p>Using a graphical chart in line with the NGO's work, I designed communication and design materials such as <a href="https://www.arocha.or.ke/news/1762/" target="_blank">Annual Reports</a>, posters, and branded objects.</p><img src="f01e782917d6d1153eca.jpg"><h4 class="title is-5">Regular communications</h4><p>To ensure regular communication, I used tools such as <a ref="https://hootsuite.com/" target="_blank">Hootsuite</a> and <a ref="https://mailchimp.com/MailChimp" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a> to organize social media posts and monthly newsletters, and drafted blog articles on current projects and stories.</p><img src="da447415f7d229ed4593.jpg"></section><footer class="modal-card-foot"></footer></div></div></body></html>
